  {
    "prompt": "What can I use instead of buttermilk?",
    "response": "Mix 1 cup milk with 1 tablespoon lemon juice or white vinegar. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes to curdle, then use as you would buttermilk."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is a substitute for Worcestershire sauce?",
    "response": "Combine 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon ketchup, and a dash of vinegar for a quick Worcestershire substitute."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What can replace heavy cream in recipes?",
    "response": "Mix 2/3 cup whole milk with 1/3 cup melted butter as a substitute for 1 cup heavy cream in most recipes."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I'm out of eggs for baking. What can I use instead?",
    "response": "For each egg, try: 1/4 cup applesauce or mashed banana (adds moisture), 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water (let sit 5 minutes), 1/4 cup silken tofu (blended), or 1 tablespoon vinegar + 1 teaspoon baking soda (for leavening). Each works differently - applesauce for moist cakes, flax for binding, tofu for dense textures."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's a good substitute for brown sugar?",
    "response": "Mix 1 cup white sugar with 1-2 tablespoons molasses for light or dark brown sugar respectively. Alternatively, use coconut sugar 1:1, or white sugar with a pinch of vanilla extract. For baking, you can also use maple syrup (reduce other liquids by 3 tablespoons per 1/4 cup syrup used)."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I don't have vanilla extract. What else can I use?",
    "response": "Try vanilla paste (use half the amount), vanilla powder (equal amount), maple syrup (1 tablespoon per teaspoon extract, reduce other liquids slightly), almond extract (use 1/4 the amount - it's stronger), or rum/bourbon (same amount). For non-alcoholic options, vanilla-flavored milk or a small amount of honey can work in some recipes."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How can I substitute butter in baking?",
    "response": "Depends on the recipe: For cookies/cakes, use equal amounts of vegetable oil, melted coconut oil, or applesauce (though texture will change). For flaky pastries, try vegetable shortening or cold coconut oil. Margarine works 1:1 but check salt content. Greek yogurt can replace half the butter for moist cakes. Each substitute affects texture differently."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What can I use instead of baking powder?",
    "response": "Mix 1/4 teaspoon baking soda with 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar to replace 1 teaspoon baking powder. Alternatively, use 1/4 teaspoon baking soda plus 1/2 cup buttermilk or yogurt (reduce other liquids by 1/2 cup). Self-rising flour contains baking powder - use it instead of regular flour but omit additional baking powder and salt."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I need a substitute for sour cream in my recipe.",
    "response": "Greek yogurt is the best 1:1 substitute. Other options: mix 1 cup heavy cream with 1 tablespoon lemon juice, use crème fraîche, or blend 1 cup cottage cheese until smooth. For vegan options, try cashew cream or coconut cream. In baking, these may slightly alter texture but maintain moisture and tanginess."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What can replace fresh garlic when I'm out?",
    "response": "Use 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder per clove, or 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic per clove. Garlic salt works too (reduce other salt in recipe). For cooking, try garlic-infused oil, minced garlic from a jar (1/2 teaspoon per clove), or shallots for a milder flavor. Asafoetida (tiny pinch) provides garlic-like flavor in Indian cuisine."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I substitute fresh herbs with dried ones?",
    "response": "Use 1/3 the amount of dried herbs compared to fresh (1 tablespoon fresh = 1 teaspoon dried). Add dried herbs early in cooking to bloom their flavors, but add fresh herbs near the end. For garnishing, fresh herbs are irreplaceable. Some herbs like basil and cilantro lose significant flavor when dried - consider herb pastes or frozen alternatives."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's a good replacement for wine in cooking?",
    "response": "For white wine: use chicken/vegetable broth, white grape juice, or apple cider vinegar diluted with water (1:3 ratio). For red wine: beef broth, grape juice, or pomegranate juice work well. Add a splash of vinegar to non-alcoholic substitutes for acidity. The liquid amount should match, but flavors will be different - wine adds complexity that's hard to replicate."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I don't have breadcrumbs. What can I use for coating?",
    "response": "Crush crackers, cornflakes, or pretzels for similar texture. Panko alternatives: crushed cornflakes or rice cereal. For gluten-free: almond flour, crushed nuts, or gluten-free oats ground fine. Parmesan cheese mixed with herbs makes a flavorful coating. Day-old bread can be processed into fresh breadcrumbs, or toast and crush any bread you have."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What can I substitute for cornstarch as a thickener?",
    "response": "All-purpose flour (use twice as much, cook longer to eliminate raw taste), arrowroot powder (1:1 ratio, add at end of cooking), potato starch (1:1 ratio), or tapioca starch (1:1 ratio). For clear sauces, arrowroot is best. Rice flour works too but may make sauces cloudy. Each has different properties - cornstarch creates glossy sauces, flour creates more opaque ones."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How can I replace cream cheese in recipes?",
    "response": "For cheesecake: Greek yogurt strained overnight, or ricotta cheese blended smooth (add a bit of heavy cream). For frosting: butter mixed with powdered sugar and a touch of vanilla. Mascarpone cheese works 1:1 but is richer. For savory dips: sour cream or Greek yogurt. Vegan options include cashew cream or vegan cream cheese alternatives."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's a substitute for honey in baking?",
    "response": "Maple syrup, agave nectar, or brown rice syrup work 1:1 but are thinner - reduce other liquids by 2-3 tablespoons per cup. Light corn syrup has similar consistency. For granulated substitute: use 1 1/4 cups sugar plus 1/4 cup water per cup of honey. Date syrup or molasses provide different flavors but work structurally. Each affects final texture and sweetness differently."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I need to replace coconut milk in my curry. What works?",
    "response": "Heavy cream with a pinch of coconut extract, whole milk with butter (2:1 ratio), or cashew cream provide richness. For lighter options: half-and-half or evaporated milk. Greek yogurt added at the end prevents curdling. Each changes the flavor profile - coconut milk's unique sweetness and richness is hard to replicate exactly, but these maintain creaminess."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What can I use instead of tomato paste?",
    "response": "Reduce tomato sauce by cooking it down (3 tablespoons sauce = 1 tablespoon paste), use ketchup (less concentrated, sweeter), or sun-dried tomato paste. Mix tomato puree with tomato powder if available. Fresh tomatoes can be cooked down but take much longer. Adjust seasoning as substitutes may be sweeter or less concentrated than tomato paste."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I substitute self-rising flour for all-purpose flour?",
    "response": "For each cup of self-rising flour, use 1 cup all-purpose flour + 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder + 1/4 teaspoon salt. If recipe calls for additional baking powder or salt, reduce accordingly. Self-rising flour already contains leavening agents, so don't add extra. This substitution works well for biscuits, muffins, and quick breads."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's a good substitute for ricotta cheese?",
    "response": "Cottage cheese (drain and blend for smoother texture), Greek yogurt (strain if too thin), or mascarpone (richer, use less). For lasagna: a mix of cream cheese and sour cream works well. Tofu-based ricotta (blend silken tofu with lemon juice and salt) is a vegan option. Each has different moisture content - adjust other liquids accordingly."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I'm out of lemon juice. What else provides acidity?",
    "response": "White vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or lime juice work 1:1 for acidity. White wine or champagne vinegar are gentler. For baking, cream of tartar provides acidity without liquid (1/4 teaspoon per tablespoon lemon juice). Orange juice is less acidic but adds citrus flavor. Each brings different flavor notes - lime is closest to lemon's brightness."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What can replace gelatin in recipes?",
    "response": "Agar-agar powder (vegan): use 1 teaspoon per tablespoon gelatin, dissolve in hot liquid. Carrageenan or pectin for jams. For mousses: whipped cream or aquafaba can provide structure. Cornstarch creates different texture but works for some puddings. Each substitute behaves differently - agar sets firmer and at room temperature, unlike gelatin which melts at body temperature."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I substitute mayonnaise in recipes?",
    "response": "Greek yogurt provides tang and creaminess (use 3/4 amount). Avocado works for sandwiches and cold salads. Sour cream is similar in richness. For baking, applesauce or mashed banana add moisture. Tahini mixed with lemon juice creates nutty flavor. Each substitute changes flavor and texture - consider the recipe's purpose when choosing."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's a substitute for anchovy paste in Caesar dressing?",
    "response": "Worcestershire sauce (1 teaspoon per 1/2 teaspoon paste), soy sauce with a drop of fish sauce, or miso paste for umami depth. Capers mashed with olive oil provide brininess. For vegetarian: nutritional yeast with soy sauce, or a small amount of seaweed (nori) ground fine. The fishy, salty complexity is unique but these provide similar savory depth."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I don't have cake flour. How can I make it?",
    "response": "For each cup of cake flour needed: measure 1 cup all-purpose flour, remove 2 tablespoons, then add 2 tablespoons cornstarch. Sift together 3 times to combine well. This creates a lighter flour similar to cake flour's lower protein content. Don't pack when measuring. This substitution works well for delicate cakes requiring tender crumb."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What can I use instead of parchment paper?",
    "response": "Grease pan well and dust with flour for baking. Silicone baking mats (reusable) work great for cookies. Aluminum foil (grease it) can work but may stick slightly. For roasting: use a well-oiled pan. Wax paper only for cold preparations - it's not heat-safe. For steaming: clean kitchen towels or coffee filters can line steamers."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I replace fish sauce in Asian cooking?",
    "response": "Soy sauce with a squeeze of lime juice and pinch of sugar provides umami and saltiness. Worcestershire sauce works surprisingly well. For vegetarian: mushroom soy sauce or dark soy sauce. Seaweed broth concentrate adds oceanic flavor. Mix soy sauce with rice vinegar and a tiny bit of sugar for complexity. Each misses fish sauce's unique funk but provides essential saltiness."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's a substitute for crème fraîche?",
    "response": "Mix 1 cup heavy cream with 1 tablespoon buttermilk, let sit at room temperature 12-24 hours until thickened. Quick version: 1 cup sour cream + 1/4 cup heavy cream. Mexican crema is similar. Greek yogurt mixed with cream works for dolloping. Mascarpone is richer but similar texture. Each has slightly different tang levels and richness."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "I need to replace molasses in my recipe. What works?",
    "response": "Dark corn syrup is closest in consistency, honey mixed with a bit of brown sugar, or maple syrup (though less robust flavor). For blackstrap molasses: use half honey + half dark corn syrup + pinch of burnt sugar or coffee extract. Brown sugar dissolved in small amount of water can work. Each substitute affects flavor significantly - molasses has unique bitter-sweet complexity."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What can I use instead of red wine vinegar?",
    "response": "Apple cider vinegar is closest in acidity and fruitiness. White wine vinegar with a drop of red food coloring, balsamic vinegar (sweeter, use less), or rice vinegar with a pinch of red pepper flakes. Lemon juice works for acidity but changes flavor profile. Each brings different complexity - red wine vinegar has specific grape notes that are hard to replicate exactly."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I substitute powdered sugar for granulated sugar?",
    "response": "Blend granulated sugar in a food processor until powdered (add 1 tablespoon cornstarch per cup for anti-caking). For recipes: 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar = 1 cup granulated sugar, but reduce other liquids by 3-4 tablespoons since powdered sugar contains cornstarch. This works for frostings but may affect texture in baked goods due to cornstarch content."
