  {
    "prompt": "How do I properly sear meat?",
    "response": "Pat the meat dry, season it, and use a hot pan with a small amount of oil. Place the meat in the pan without crowding, and avoid moving it until a golden crust forms. Flip and repeat. Searing locks in juices and enhances flavor."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is the best way to chop onions without crying?",
    "response": "Use a sharp knife, chill the onion beforehand, and cut near an open flame or vent. Breathing through your mouth and cutting the root last can also help reduce tears."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How can I tell if fish is cooked properly?",
    "response": "Cooked fish will be opaque rather than translucent and will flake easily with a fork. The internal temperature should reach 63°C (145°F)."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the difference between braising and stewing?",
    "response": "Braising uses less liquid and typically involves larger cuts of meat that are partially submerged, while stewing uses more liquid to completely cover smaller, uniform pieces of meat. Braising is done in the oven or stovetop with the pot covered, creating a combination of steaming and simmering."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I make a proper roux for thickening sauces?",
    "response": "Heat equal parts butter and flour in a pan over medium heat. Whisk constantly to prevent burning. Cook for 2-3 minutes for white roux (mild flavor), 5-7 minutes for blonde roux (nutty flavor), or 10-15 minutes for brown roux (rich, complex flavor). The longer you cook, the less thickening power but more flavor."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the best technique for tempering chocolate?",
    "response": "Use the seeding method: melt 2/3 of your chocolate to 50-55°C, then add the remaining 1/3 as 'seed' chocolate while stirring. This brings the temperature down to 27-28°C. Gently reheat to 31-32°C for dark chocolate (29-30°C for milk/white). Properly tempered chocolate will have a glossy finish and crisp snap."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I prevent my pasta from sticking together?",
    "response": "Use plenty of salted boiling water (4-6 liters per 500g pasta), stir immediately after adding pasta, and stir occasionally while cooking. Don't add oil to the water as it prevents sauce from adhering. Reserve pasta water before draining to help bind sauces."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the proper way to rest meat after cooking?",
    "response": "Tent the meat loosely with foil and let it rest for 5-10 minutes for smaller cuts, 15-20 minutes for larger roasts. This allows juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in more tender, juicy results. The internal temperature will also rise 5-10°F during resting."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I achieve the perfect scrambled eggs?",
    "response": "Use low heat, whisk eggs with a splash of cream or milk, and add to a buttered pan. Stir constantly with a spatula, pushing cooked portions to center while tilting pan to let uncooked egg flow underneath. Remove from heat while slightly underdone as they'll continue cooking. Season at the end."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the secret to fluffy pancakes?",
    "response": "Don't overmix the batter - lumps are okay. Mix wet and dry ingredients separately, then combine with minimal stirring. Let batter rest 5-10 minutes. Use buttermilk for tang and tenderness, and make sure your griddle is at medium heat (375°F). Flip only once when bubbles form and edges look set."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I properly season a cast iron pan?",
    "response": "Clean the pan thoroughly, dry completely, and heat in 200°F oven. Apply a thin layer of high smoke-point oil (like flaxseed or grapeseed) all over. Wipe excess oil away - the pan shouldn't look greasy. Heat at 500°F for 1 hour, then let cool in oven. Repeat 3-6 times for best results."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the best way to store fresh herbs?",
    "response": "For soft herbs like basil and parsley, trim stems and place in water like flowers, cover with plastic bag, and refrigerate. For hardy herbs like rosemary and thyme, wrap in damp paper towels and store in plastic bags in the fridge. Most herbs last 1-2 weeks this way."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I make homemade stock from scratch?",
    "response": "For chicken stock: Use bones, aromatics (onion, carrot, celery), herbs (parsley, thyme, bay leaf), and peppercorns. Cover with cold water, bring to gentle simmer, skim foam regularly. Simmer 3-4 hours for chicken, 6-8 hours for beef. Strain through fine mesh, cool quickly, and remove fat layer when chilled."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the proper knife technique for brunoise cut?",
    "response": "Brunoise is a precise 1/8-inch dice. First, create a julienne cut: square off the vegetable, cut into 1/8-inch planks, stack and cut into 1/8-inch strips. Then cut perpendicular to create uniform 1/8-inch cubes. Keep fingertips curved and knuckles forward for safety."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I prevent curdling when making hollandaise sauce?",
    "response": "Keep water bath at gentle simmer, not boiling. Add melted butter very slowly while whisking constantly. If it starts to curdle, remove from heat and whisk in a tablespoon of cold water or lemon juice. You can also start over with a fresh egg yolk and slowly whisk in the curdled mixture."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the difference between baking soda and baking powder?",
    "response": "Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate and needs acid to activate (like buttermilk, lemon juice). It provides immediate lift and should be used right away. Baking powder contains baking soda plus cream of tartar (acid) and sometimes cornstarch. Double-acting baking powder releases CO2 twice: when mixed and when heated."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I properly proof yeast for bread making?",
    "response": "Dissolve active dry yeast in warm water (105-110°F) with a pinch of sugar. Wait 5-10 minutes until foamy and bubbly. If there's no foam, the yeast is dead. For instant yeast, you can mix directly with flour. Water that's too hot (over 140°F) will kill the yeast."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the best method for cooking risotto?",
    "response": "Use arborio, carnaroli, or vialone nano rice. Toast rice in oil until translucent edges appear. Add warm stock one ladle at a time, stirring constantly until absorbed before adding more. This takes 18-20 minutes. Finish with butter, parmesan, and seasoning. The texture should be creamy but rice grains still have slight bite."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I render fat properly for cooking?",
    "response": "Cut fat into small, uniform pieces. Start in a cold pan over low heat to prevent burning. Stir occasionally as fat slowly melts and renders. For bacon fat, this takes 10-15 minutes. Strain the rendered fat through fine mesh to remove crispy bits. Store in refrigerator for up to 3 months."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the proper way to fold ingredients when baking?",
    "response": "Use a large spoon or spatula in a cutting and turning motion. Cut down through the center of the mixture, across the bottom, up the side, and over the top. Rotate bowl quarter-turn and repeat. This preserves air bubbles in delicate batters. Fold just until ingredients are combined - overmixing deflates the mixture."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I make clarified butter (ghee)?",
    "response": "Melt unsalted butter in heavy-bottomed pan over low heat. Don't stir. As butter melts, foam will appear on surface - skim this off. Continue cooking until milk solids settle to bottom and liquid becomes clear golden color. Strain through cheesecloth to remove all solids. Clarified butter has higher smoke point and longer shelf life."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the best technique for making mayonnaise by hand?",
    "response": "Use room temperature ingredients. Whisk egg yolk with mustard and acid (lemon juice/vinegar) until pale. Very slowly drizzle oil while whisking constantly - start with drops, then thin stream. If it breaks, start with fresh yolk and slowly whisk in broken mayo. Add oil until desired consistency is reached."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I properly blanch vegetables?",
    "response": "Bring large pot of heavily salted water to rolling boil. Add vegetables and cook briefly until bright in color and tender-crisp. Immediately transfer to ice water bath to stop cooking process. This preserves color, texture, and nutrients. Blanching times vary: green beans 3-4 minutes, broccoli 2-3 minutes, asparagus 2-4 minutes depending on thickness."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the proper internal temperature for different meat doneness levels?",
    "response": "For beef: Rare 120-125°F, Medium-rare 130-135°F, Medium 135-145°F, Medium-well 145-155°F, Well-done 155°F+. For pork: 145°F with 3-minute rest. For poultry: 165°F for breast, 175°F for thigh. For lamb: same as beef. Use instant-read thermometer for accuracy and always let meat rest before carving."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I make perfect caramel without burning it?",
    "response": "Use heavy-bottomed pan and medium heat. Add sugar in even layer - don't stir once melting begins, just swirl pan gently. Sugar will clump then melt into amber liquid. Watch carefully as it can burn quickly. Remove from heat when deep amber color is reached. Carefully add warm cream while whisking - mixture will bubble violently."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the difference between various cooking oils and their best uses?",
    "response": "Extra virgin olive oil: Low-medium heat, finishing, dressings. Vegetable/canola oil: High heat, neutral flavor, frying. Coconut oil: Medium heat, baking, adds subtle flavor. Avocado oil: Very high smoke point, grilling, roasting. Sesame oil: Finishing touch, Asian dishes. Butter: Low-medium heat, flavor, browning. Choose based on smoke point and flavor profile needed."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I properly emulsify a vinaigrette?",
    "response": "Start with acid (vinegar/lemon juice) and emulsifiers (mustard, egg yolk, or honey) in bowl. Whisk while very slowly drizzling oil to create stable emulsion. Ratio is typically 3:1 oil to acid, but adjust to taste. For temporary emulsion, whisk vigorously or shake in jar. For longer-lasting emulsion, use immersion blender or food processor."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the proper technique for kneading bread dough?",
    "response": "On lightly floured surface, push dough away from you with heel of hand, fold over, turn quarter-turn, and repeat. Knead 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Properly kneaded dough springs back when poked and passes the windowpane test - you can stretch a small piece thin enough to see through without tearing. Add flour sparingly to prevent sticking."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I rescue oversalted soup or sauce?",
    "response": "Add acid (lemon juice, vinegar) to balance saltiness. Dilute with unsalted liquid (water, stock, cream). Add starch (potato, rice, pasta) to absorb salt. For tomato-based dishes, add sugar to counteract. Raw potato chunks can absorb some salt - remove before serving. Prevention is best: taste frequently and season gradually."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the best method for cooking perfect rice?",
    "response": "Use absorption method: 1 cup rice to 1.5-2 cups liquid depending on type. Rinse rice until water runs clear to remove excess starch. Bring liquid to boil, add rice, reduce to lowest heat, cover tightly. Cook 18 minutes for white rice, 45 minutes for brown rice. Don't lift lid during cooking. Let rest 10 minutes off heat before fluffing with fork."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I properly store and reheat leftover rice safely?",
    "response": "Cool rice quickly and refrigerate within 2 hours. Store in shallow containers for faster cooling. Use within 3-4 days. To reheat, add 1-2 tablespoons liquid per cup of rice, cover, and microwave or steam until heated through (165°F). Never leave rice at room temperature for extended periods due to bacterial growth risk."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the proper way to clean and maintain kitchen knives?",
    "response": "Hand wash immediately after use with warm soapy water - never put in dishwasher. Dry thoroughly before storing. Store in knife block, magnetic strip, or blade guards. Hone regularly with steel rod before each use. Professional sharpening every 6-12 months depending on usage. Keep blades away from hard surfaces like glass cutting boards."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I make compound butter for finishing dishes?",
    "response": "Soften butter to room temperature. Mix in herbs, spices, citrus zest, garlic, or other flavoring agents. Place mixture on parchment paper, roll into log shape, and refrigerate until firm. Slice rounds as needed to top steaks, vegetables, or bread. Compound butter can be frozen for up to 3 months."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What's the difference between various flour types and their uses?",
    "response": "All-purpose flour: 10-12% protein, versatile for most baking. Bread flour: 12-14% protein, high gluten for chewy breads. Cake flour: 7-9% protein, fine texture for tender cakes. Pastry flour: 8-10% protein, for flaky pastries. Self-rising flour: all-purpose with baking powder and salt added. Whole wheat flour: includes bran and germ, nuttier flavor, denser texture."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I properly segment citrus fruits?",
    "response": "Cut off top and bottom of fruit to expose flesh. Place cut-side down and follow curve of fruit to remove peel and white pith with knife. Hold fruit over bowl and cut along membrane lines to release segments. Work over bowl to catch juices. Remove any seeds. This technique gives you clean citrus segments without bitter pith."
